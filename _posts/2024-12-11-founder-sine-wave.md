## "How’s It Going?"

A few weeks ago, someone casually asked me, “How’s it going?”

I paused. It wasn’t because I didn’t want to answer, but because I didn’t know how to capture the reality of what I was experiencing. Was it going great? Absolutely. Just last week, we closed a major partnership deal. But was it also incredibly hard? No doubt about it. That same week, I had a sleepless night, worrying about the next set of challenges.

I eventually replied, “It’s like riding a wave.” And that’s when the image started to take shape in my mind.

## The Gentle Undulations of Employment

Back in my previous job, life was steady. Sure, there were deadlines and occasional stress, but the emotional extremes were contained. Wins were satisfying but never electrifying. Setbacks were manageable, seldom leaving a lasting impact.

It was a comfortable existence—a life lived on a small sine wave. The highs and lows stayed close to a neutral baseline, offering predictability and security.

## Founding a Startup: A New Amplitude

When I became a founder, everything changed. The sine wave grew taller and deeper. Successes weren’t just good; they were euphoric. Failures weren’t just setbacks; they were gut-wrenching. The stakes weren’t just professional—they were personal.

The journey of a founder isn’t for the faint of heart. The highs are breathtaking, but the lows can leave you questioning your path.

### Peaks That Take Your Breath Away

When things go right as a founder, they *really* go right:

- **Closing Deals:** Each agreement isn’t just revenue; it’s a validation of your vision.
- **Building a Team:** Watching talented individuals rally behind your dream feels deeply fulfilling.
- **Shipping Products:** Seeing an idea take physical form and enter the world is pure magic.

These highs make you feel unstoppable, like you’re standing on top of the world.

### Troughs That Test Your Resolve

But then there are the lows—and they’re not for the faint of heart:

- **Setbacks:** A missed milestone can feel like the end of the road.
- **Team Challenges:** Losing a key member hits harder because it’s not just about roles—it’s about trust.
- **Financial Pressure:** Every month brings existential questions about sustainability and survival.

These lows are isolating, casting long shadows over even the brightest victories.

## Why a Sine Wave?

As I sat reflecting on that wave metaphor, I realized the founder’s journey is the perfect sine wave:

- **Positive Axis (Highs):** The moments of success and triumph.
- **Negative Axis (Lows):** The depths of doubt and failure.
- **Amplitude:** The emotional intensity that sets the founder apart from a steady career.

For founders, the peaks are higher, and the troughs are deeper than for most others. But it’s the magnitude of this wave that makes it worthwhile.

## Riding the Wave

If you ask me again, “How’s it going?” I might just say, “It’s a sine wave.”

That’s the truth of this journey. It’s not smooth sailing, nor is it ever flat. It’s a constant oscillation between euphoria and despair. And yet, every low is a setup for the next high.

### Embrace the Amplitude

If you’re a founder or dreaming of becoming one, know this: the lows will challenge you, but the highs will remind you why you started. The sine wave isn’t a flaw; it’s the design. And when you embrace it, you’ll find the strength to ride it.

**Welcome to the founder’s sine wave. Let’s ride it together.**
